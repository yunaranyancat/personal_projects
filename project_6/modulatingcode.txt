Modulating
- process of splitting up our programs into multiple files
- allows for complex packages to be made
- great for writing tool packs for other developers

Designing
- Design with multiple files in mind
- You will learn what works for you and what doesn't
- Try to keep common classes in their own file.
- Make sure each file has a purpose.
- We use the import keyword or alternatively the from keyword.

Let's try it out.
vector2dmod.py
mod.py (this will use the vector2dmod.py file/module)

Packages
- Hierarchical structure to large compilations of modules
- Eg: Physics engines, networking tools or even things like GUI packages.
- There will be a package.zip with a sample of what a package looks like.
- If you are interested in making your own packages, reading the comments in each .py files will be highly beneficial.

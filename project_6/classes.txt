What's a class?

- A class is referred to as a Data Structure or Type.
- Holds data and behaviors. These are called Attributes and Methods.

How do we make one?

- Python adds as little new syntax as possible for classes.
- for now we will only look at the keyword class.
- Syntax:
  class MyClass:

- This will create a class called MyClass.

Atttributes
- Variables that belong to a class.
- Always public (can be accessed after the '.')
- MyClass.MyAttribute

Methods
- Functions that belong to a class.
- Either does somethign to the classes data OR does something with the classes data.

Objects
- Objects are much like a variable, however , it holds a whole classes information inside.
- Can create multiple instances of an object/class, Hence 'Objects';
- Can store and manipulate information inside the object, much like we do with the string class/object.

Let's create a class
- We will make a class called MyClass
- Inside we will store a favorite number and a name.
- Let's call our program myclass.py

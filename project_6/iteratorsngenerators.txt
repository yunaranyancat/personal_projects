Iterators

- used to loop through the items of a container
- You have used them before!
 for element in [1, 2, 3]
- Python uses the __iter__() method to return an iterator object of the class.
- The iterator object then uses the __next__() method to get the next item.
- The for loop stops when the StopIteration Exception is raised.

Let's try it out
revserse.py

Generators
- Another way of creating iterators
- Uses a function rather than a separate class
- Generates the background code for the next() and iter() methods.
- Uses a special statement called yield which saves the state of the generator and set a resume point for when next() is called again.

Generator Expressions
- Generator Expressions are a unique feature that python uses.
- Allows for iteration to be handled in a single line expression.
- Uncommonly used by a lot of programmers.

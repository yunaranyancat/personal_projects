Inheritance
- concept of inheriting features from another class.
- useful if two or more classes share common attributes or methods.
- can use methods from the super class
- a more organized and modular way to design programs (not all programs though).

Terminology
- Base class or Super class - The class that is inherited from.
- Subclass - inherits from a base/super class
- You can have subclasses of other subclasses.

Let's try it out
pets.py

Polymorphism
- Concept of dynamic methods chosen at runtime
- Subclasses must override the base classes method
- Useful for lists of different types of subclasses.

Adding Polymorphism
- A talk method which will do something different for each pet.
- The list will be a list of Pet classes because both Dogs and Cats are Pet classes.
- We're also adding dogs.

Multiple Inheritance
- You can inherit from more than one base class by separating them with a comma
- Be careful, if two or more base classes share the same attribute names or method names you can get some bad behavior.

Shitty obfuscated fake installer.

Note : It's obfuscated because I want to test pyarmor and my code is shitty.

Purpose : Can be used to waste time

Installation
1. Download project file and go inside the directory
2. run pip install -r requirements.txt
3. run python install.py [option]

For the [option] there are three types of string you can use:

basic - took exactly 15 minutes to complete

complete - took exactly 30 minutes to complete

advanced - took exactly 45 minutes to complete

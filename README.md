This repo is created just to improve my Python programming skills and to keep me up to date with the new python modules/libraries. Some of the programs will be created using Python2 or Python3 for some compatibility purposes. If you have any comment regarding my codes, please contact me directly at mzulfiqar.wardi@gmail.com.

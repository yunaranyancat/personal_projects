This project is about creating a cryptocurrency using the basic knowledge of a blockchain.

The program will be based on python.

My blockchain will be called CatChain and have these particular characteristics;
- The genesis block will have a random hash function and it will be introduced into the terminal with a constant data = 'Genesis' and it's hash.
- When the genesis block has been generated, new generated block will contain random string in this list:
["cat", "no cat"]
- Incoming interesting ideas....

This project is about creating a cryptocurrency using the basic knowledge of a blockchain.

The program will be based on python.

My blockchain will be called ynChain and have these particular characteristics;
- The genesis block will have a random hash function and it will be introduced into the terminal with a constant data = 'genesis'.
- When the genesis block has been generated, 9 more blocks will follow the genesis block and make it a blockchain with 10 blocks, and the data for each blocks is a random number between 1 and 0.
- Incoming interesting ideas....

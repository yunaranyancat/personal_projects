Preamble

- this tutorial is about web interfacing, having a basic understanding of HTML and how it works will be very helpful.
- if you have done any PHP before, this will be familiar however in Python.

What is CGI?

- CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface
- CGI is the standard for programs to interface with HTTP servers. (Some other servers too.)
- this means we can take information from things like Forms.
- CGI scripts generally go in a web server's cgi-bin directory.

What is CGI Programming?

- CGI Programming is writing dynamically generating WebPages that respond to user input or WebPages that interact with software on the server.
- Things like Dropbox use python for it's web interface.

Setup

- To be able to get our CGI to work, we need a web server we can play with.
- If you have your own web server and want to use that go ahead.
- If you don't, let's quickly set up and apache2 web server.
- To install Apache2(which should be a standard package in almost all linux distro's) we use:
 sudo apt-get install apache2
- Then we must set the web server permissions to allow cgi programs to execute.
 For simplicity, we will allow cgi to execute in the root directory.

 ******************************************
 edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

 DocumentRoot /var/www/html -> /var/www/html
 add <Directory /var/www/>
   Options ExecCGI Indexes FollowSymLinks Multiviews
   AllowOverride None
   Oder allow,deny
   allow from all
   AddHandler cgi-script .py
 </Directory>

 Restart webserver : sudo service apache2 restart

 ****************************************

 Basic CGI python script

 - Let's create a basic script that just prints out that it worked and print hello world 5 times.
 - Let's call it hello.py
 - Must have a line telling the web server where python is installed eg.
 #!/usr/bin/python
 - We also have to change the file permissions so it can execute (chmod 755 hello.py)

 - create hello.py
 - sudo chmod 755 hrllo.py
 - sudo cp hello.py /var/www/
 - sudo a2enmod cgi

 The cgi module

 - The cgi module contains a lot of declarations and does a lot of initializing in the background
 - Because of this NEVER use:
  from cgi import ...
 - Provides us with methods to get POST and GET requests from the web server
 - As well as a few other methods for parsing data

 Using Form data
 - The python sgi module handles POST and GET with the same method.
 - cgi.FieldStorage() this method will return a FieldStorage object that allows us to get data from a submitted form
 - We can use the FieldStorage object like a python dictionary or we can use the getvalue() method.
  (I suggest not using this method as it will crash of there is more than one field with the same name, but for now, it's fine)
 - Alternative methods are getfirst() and getlist() (Safe)

 Simple hello 'insert name' program
 - Let's create a simple script that grabs the entered name from POST and prints out hello to that name.
 - Let's just modify our hello.py file.
 - Then lets add a check box to see if they are happy or sad or both.

Notes

- When debugging your code you can use the cgitb(cgi traceback) module to output errors to the page
- Import cgitb
 cgitb.enable()
- The cgitb.enable() can be modified so that the error messages are saved to a file rather than output to users of your script. This can be done with:
 cgitb.enable(display=0, logdir="/path/")
- cgi.escape(). try to always escape user input if you plan to use it

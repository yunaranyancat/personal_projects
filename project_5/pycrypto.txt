Preamble
- This tutorial is about using Cryptographic algorithms to encrypt data with python. having a basic understanding of python is required.
- Having some knowledge of Cryptography will be helpful but not necessary to follow along.
- If you are running on Windows, pyCrypto is available on the python package index.

What is PyCrypto?
- PyCrypto's go to package for Cryptographic modules.
- Contains Symmetric and Asymmetric Ciphers, Hashing algorithms, Cryptographic Protocols, Public-key encryption and signature algorithms and it's own crypto-strong random functions.

What is Cryptography?
- Typically Cryptography refers to encryption of plaintext(readable) into ciphertext(unreadable) and the reverse, decryption of ciphertext into plaintext.
- A Cipher is used with a Key which will produce what looks like a random output. The strength of an algorithm is measured in how easily an adversary can break the encryption

AES
- Advanced Encryption Standard
- Symmetric Cipher
- 16 byte block size
- The keys can be 128, 192, or 256 bits long.
- Has many block ciphers modes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation

IV
- Stands for Initialization Vector
- Used to randomize and produce distinct ciphertexts for certain cipher modes.
- You should not reuse the same IV for two separate encryptions with the same key/password.
- The IV can be known for most modes.

Hashing a Password
- Because a cipher requires a key of certain length it's useful to hash the users password to produce the same length key every time.
- SHA256 produces a 16 byte output and works great with AES-256.

File encrypt program
- Let's create a file encrypting and decrypting program.
- Let's call it encrypt.py

Notes

- Not all of the ciphers and hashes in the pyCrypto library are considered safe. Make sure you at least look up the correct algorithm to be used for your situation.
- All of the algorithms are open source and you can read them.
- Never try to create your own algorithm unless you know what you are doing and have a team of experts.

In this project, I will create a program based on a Python library, called pycrypto..

The name of the program will be creepto(subject to be changed in the future,but,creepto, why not?)

Pre requirements:
pycrypto library (install in Ubuntu by using pip3 install pycrypto)

Resources:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto
https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/

Incoming interesting ideas..
